In V2.0, there are an optional dictionary and three translators: DeepL, Papago, and Offline

SETTINGS:
In V2.0, you can now easily change translation language to other language like Spanish or French, or many more
Open Settings.json with notepad or notepad++ then edit the translation language abbreviation to your language of choice 
Check the DeepL and Papago URL for the abbreviation of translation language


DICTIONARY PROGRAM: 
Go to dictionary program folder and click on the exe
The program listened to clipboard and will offer text highlighting and definition lookup


PAPAGO:
It seemed that Papago's accuracy is better than Google so I included it in this version
It can take around 30-45 seconds for Papago to setup, however it is much faster than DeepL when started
You should be able to see "Hello Papago" when it done setting up


OFFLINE MODEL GUIDE:
For offline mode, I replace the big model (2.5GB) with the base model (900MB) so the program is lighter

Use big model if you have at least 8GB RAM and above.
Use small and base model if you have 4GB RAM and above.

To replace a model, head to this website http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/jparacrawl/
Get the model of your choice for Japanese-to-English

Copy that model (ex: small.pretrain.pt) to offlineTranslation/fairseq/japaneseModel
Remove the current "big.pretrain.pt" model 
Change your model name to "big.pretrain.pt"


DEBUGGING:
Some users complained about the program not listening to clipboard. 
There are two things you can try. 
1st, join my discord (link on the youtube videos on my channel)
2nd, download vc_redist.x86.exe on Microsoft page
