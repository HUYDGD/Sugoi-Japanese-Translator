Bonus: Try out my two other programs if you haven't yet: Manga Rikai OCR and Visual Novel OCR

Note: DO NOT MINIMIZE CHROMIUM, instead, resize the browser window and put it behind the game window (examples in folder)

There is a way to not show Chromium and I included it in the folder. 
Open "DeepL-Settings.json" with notepad or notepad++ 
Change "hideBrowserWindowTrueOrFalse" to true to hide browserWindow
I set the default way with browser opened because there is a possibility DeepL asked you to solve Captcha

This program used web-scraping for DeepL so it relies on fixed HTML id on the website. 
I included "inputTextboxID" and "resultTextboxID" in the settings. 
If the program somehow not worked, you might want to recheck the id on the page
